# RLSTM
A C passion project aiming to recreate how Long Short-Term Memory Networks work.
As of now the forward pass functionality is fully complete.

## How to build and run
First, ensure that the [Gnu Scientific Library](https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/gnu/gsl/) is installed on your computer.

```make && ./build/main```

Internal structure of the libraries i've written:
